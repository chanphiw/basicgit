## Introduction

### What is Angular?

Angular is a powerful, open-source, TypeScript-based front-end web application framework developed by Google. It's used for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) and complex enterprise-grade web solutions. Angular provides a robust structure and set of tools for developing large-scale, maintainable applications.

### Key Features of Angular 20

Angular 20 is expected to build upon the innovations from previous versions, focusing on performance, developer experience, and enhanced reactivity. Key features likely include:

* **Improved Hydration & SSR Performance:** Further enhancements to Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and hydration for faster initial page loads and better SEO.
* **Maturity of Signals:** Deeper integration and potential widespread adoption of the Signals reactivity model across the framework.
* **Enhanced Build Performance:** Faster build times and smaller bundle sizes due to advancements in the Angular CLI and underlying build tools.
* **Refined Standalone APIs:** Continued evolution and simplification of standalone components, directives, and pipes, making `NgModule` optional for most new applications.
* **Accessibility (A11y) Improvements:** Tools and guidelines for building more accessible web applications.
* **New Control Flow (Built-in @if, @for, @switch):** Stable and performant built-in control flow in templates, removing the need for `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, etc.
* **TypeScript Support:** Full support for the latest TypeScript features.

### Angular vs. Other Frameworks

* **Angular vs. React:** Angular is a full-fledged framework with opinionated structure, offering a complete solution from routing to state management. React is a library for building UIs, offering more flexibility but often requiring additional libraries for full application development.
* **Angular vs. Vue:** Vue is known for its progressive adoption and ease of learning, bridging the gap between a library and a full framework. Angular offers a more comprehensive and structured approach, ideal for large enterprise applications.

## Roadmap to Mastery

This section outlines a suggested learning path:

1.  **Fundamentals:** Understand basic Angular concepts, TypeScript, and the CLI.
2.  **Components & Templates:** Master building UI blocks and displaying data.
3.  **Services & DI:** Learn how to share logic and data across components.
4.  **Routing:** Navigate between different views in your application.
5.  **Forms:** Handle user input with reactive and template-driven forms.
6.  **Reactivity (Signals & RxJS):** Understand how Angular handles change detection and asynchronous operations.
7.  **Advanced Topics:** Dive into state management, testing, and performance optimization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with Angular 20, you'll need:

* **Node.js:** Latest LTS (Long Term Support) version installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm or Yarn:** Package managers, usually installed with Node.js.
* **TypeScript:** Angular is built with TypeScript, so basic knowledge is beneficial.
* **Basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS knowledge.**

### Installation (Angular CLI)

The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is your primary tool for developing Angular applications.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@next # Install the latest pre-release for Angular 20
# or
npm install -g @angular/cli # For stable latest version if Angular 20 is released
