üìã Setting up your environment
This curriculum has a development environment ready to go! As you get started you can choose to run the curriculum in a Codespace (a browser-based, no installs needed environment), or locally on your computer using a text editor such as Visual Studio Code.

Create your repository

Running the curriculum locally on your computer
To run this curriculum locally on your computer, you will need a text editor, a browser and a command line tool. Our first lesson, Introduction to Programming Languages and Tools of the Trade, will walk you through various options for each of these tools for you to select what works best for you.

Our recommendation is to use Visual Studio Code as your editor, which also has a built-in Terminal. You can download Visual Studio Code here.

Clone your repository to your computer. You can do this by clicking the Code button and copying the URL:

Copy your repository URL
Then, open Terminal within Visual Studio Code and run the following command, replacing <your-repository-url> with the URL you just copied:

git clone <your-repository-url>
Open the folder in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by clicking File > Open Folder and selecting the folder you just cloned.
